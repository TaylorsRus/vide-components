# ðŸ§© Vide UI Components

A collection of super generic, unstyled UI components made for [**Vide**](https://github.com/centau/vide).  
Theyâ€™re inspired by how UI is built on the web â€” think React, Tailwind, or headless components â€” but made to work nicely with Vide and Roblox.

## ðŸ§  Type Safety & Boilerplate

To keep things type-safe and predictable, some components use a bit of extra boilerplate â€”  
mostly around utility functions and custom-defined types. This helps everything play nicely with strict type checking in Luau.

If you're using your own utils or type system, feel free to adapt or replace them.
